	<!-- Description -->
	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<p>This one credit-hour course is the Emerging Scholars Program (ESP) workshop associated with MATH 215 Introduction to Advanced Mathematics. 
	The purpose of this workshop is to reinforce the ideas covered in MATH 215 and provide an opportunity for students to gain more practice with problem-solving. 
	In particular, we will focus understanding what constitutes a mathematical proof and how to write effective proofs. </p>
	
	<p>Throughout the course, we will be working on problems in groups during class time in order to help everyone actively engage with the material.
	Each week, we will discuss a new topic, and groups will be assigned a problem or problems to work on from that topic. 
	Each group will be expected to have some form of write-up of a solution or attempts at a solution that I can give feedback on by the end of each class.
	If class time allows, we may incorporate groups giving short presentations on the solutions to their problems.
