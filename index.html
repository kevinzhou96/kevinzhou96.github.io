	<!-- About -->
	<p style="padding-top:1em">
		Hi! I'm a sixth-year PhD student in the <a href="https://mscs.uic.edu">Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://uic.edu">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>. I expect to graduate in Summer 2024. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~freitag/">James Freitag</a>. You can reach me at kzhou23 [at] uic.edu. <br>
		My CV is available <a href="cv.pdf">here</a>.
	</p>

	<!-- Research -->
	<h2>Research</h2>
	<p>My research interests lie in mathematical logic, more specifically model theory. I'm currently working on connections between model theory, computational learning theory, finite combinatorics, and theoretical computer science.</p>

	<h3>Papers</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Query learning bounds for advice and nominal automata (submitted)</li>
		<li>Hereditary properties and weighted model counting (in preparation)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Fellowships & Funding</h3>

	<p>
		In Spring 2022, I was a <a href="https://tripods.uic.edu/tripods-research-assistants/">UIC NSF TRIPODS Graduate Fellow</a>. <br>
		In Summer 2019, I was a UIC NSF RTG Pre-doctoral Fellow.
	</p>

	<h2>Teaching</h2>

	<p>In Spring 2024, I am a TA for MCS 260 Introduction to Computer Science. <br>
	My office hours are Thursdays 10am-12pm in the <a href="https://mslc.uic.edu/">MSLC</a>.</p>

	<p>At UIC, I have been an Instructor for the following courses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>MATH 294 Emerging Scholars Workshop for MATH 330 (Abstract Algebra I) <a href="https://mscs.uic.edu/undergraduate/esp/">(about the ESP program at UIC)</a> </li>
		<li>MATH 294 Emerging Scholars Workshop for MATH 215 (Introduction to Advanced Mathematics)</li>
		<li>MATH 179 Emerging Scholars Workshop for Calculus I</li>
		<li>MATH 090 Intermediate Algebra</li>
		<li>Summer Enrichment Workshop in Mathematics - MATH 090</li>
	</ul>

	<p>At UIC, I have been a TA for the following courses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>MATH 090 Intermediate Algebra</li>
		<li>MATH 110 College Algebra</li>
		<li>MATH 125 Elementary Linear Algebra</li>
		<li>MATH 180 Calculus I</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In Spring 2024, I am a mentor for the <a href="https://homepages.math.uic.edu/~mgintz2/drp/">Directed Reading Program at UIC</a>, a mentorship program that pairs undergraduate students with graduate student mentors working on a semester-long reading project.</p>

	<p>In Fall 2022, I was a TA for the <a href="https://swc-math.github.io/aws/2023/2023PAWS.html">Preliminary Arizona Winter School</a> on Heights and Model Theory.</p>

	<p style="padding-top: 12pt">Outside of teaching at the undergraduate and graduate level, I love teaching fun and interesting math topics to middle and high school students. Some opportunities I've had for this include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://mathcirclesofchicago.org">Math Circles of Chicago</a>, one of many math circles around globe, which provides free after-school programs for 5-12th graders across Chicago, and</li>
		<li>the <a href="https://willp.people.uic.edu/YSP/">Young Scholars Program at UIC</a>, a free summer day camp for high schoolers in the Chicagoland area.</li>
	</ul>

	<p style="padding-top: 12pt">During my time as an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, I was a TA for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/">15-251 Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science</a></li>
		<li>21-127 Concepts of Mathematics</li>
	</ul>

	<!-- Other work-->
	<h2>Other work</h2>
	<p>I've worked on a variety of research projects in the past unrelated to my current mathematical research. Code for some of these projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/kevinzhou96">GitHub</a>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In Summer 2023, I participated in <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/graduate-level-research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-g-rips-sendai-2023/">G-RIPS Sendai</a>, where I worked on a projected titled "Automated negotiation for supply chain management", and also served as team lead. Our team explored reinforcement learning methods for automated negotiation in the <a href="https://scml.cs.brown.edu/">Supply Chain Management League</a> competition. (<a href="https://github.com/kevinzhou96/grips-nec-2023">repo</a>)</li>
		<li>In Summer 2017, I worked on a project developing a simulation testbed for cascading failures in power systems. (<a href="https://github.com/kevinzhou96/CascadingFailureSimulation">repo</a>)</li>
		<li>In Summer 2016, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Baidu USA as part of Baidu Security X-Lab. I worked on developing data visualization tools for software security researchers.</li>
	</ul>

	<!-- Misc -->
	<h2>Miscellany</h2>
	<p>Outside of mathematics, I enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUu1Wjz0rwPEVPfSglTvMFg">making music</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65690902-kevin-zhou">reading</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/kazookevo">watching anime</a>, playing video games, and exercising (usually some combination of weightlifting, running, and volleyball). <br>
	I am a covenant member of <a href="https://cotb.life">Church of the Beloved</a>, where also formerly served on staff part-time as Production Manager. <br>
	I'm proficient in Mandarin Chinese (你好!) and am currently self-studying Japanese (こんにちは!).</p>
