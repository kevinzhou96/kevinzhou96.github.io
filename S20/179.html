	<!-- Description -->
	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	<p>This course complements MATH 180, but goes beyond the material and focuses on how to solve problems and effectively express mathematical arguments rather than on just getting the right solution. We will be working collaboratively in groups, completing worksheets based on course material. You are expected to be prepared and engaged in the course, and to focus on figuring things out for yourselves, explaining them to each other, and presenting them to the whole class. </p>
