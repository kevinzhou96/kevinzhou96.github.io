	<p>I am a second-year PhD student in the <a href="mscs.uic.edu">Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science</a> at the <a href="uic.edu">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>. I can be reached at kzhou23[at]uic.edu. <br>
	My CV is available <a href="cv.pdf">here</a>. </p>


	<h2>Research</h2>
	<p>My research interests lie in Mathematical Logic and Model Theory. I am currently working on some connections between model theory, machine learning theory, and finite combinatorics.</p>


	<h2>Teaching</h2>
	<p>I am currently a TA for <a href="https://www.math.uic.edu/persisting_utilities/coursepages/math110/index_html">MATH 110 (College Algebra)</a>.<br>
	At UIC, I have been a TA for the following courses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>MATH 180 (Calculus I) <i>(S19)</i>
		<li>MATH 090 (Intermediate Algebra) <i>(F18)</i>
	</ul>

	<p style="padding-top: 12pt">During the 2019-2020 academic year, I have been teaching for <a href="https://mathcirclesofchicago.org">Math Circles of Chicago</a>, one of many math circles around globe. Math Circles of Chicago provides free after-school programs for 5-12th graders designed to help kids explore interesting and meaningful mathematics that they might not see otherwise in the classroom.</p>

	<p style="padding-top: 12pt">During my time as an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, I was a TA for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>15-251 Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science <i>(F17, S18)</i>
		<li>21-127 Concepts of Mathematics <i>(S16)</i>
	</ul>


	<h2>Misc</h2>
	<p>Outside of mathematics, I enjoy playing and listening to music, reading and exercise. <br>
	I am a covenant member of <a href="http://thebelovedchurch.org">Church of the Beloved</a>.</p>
